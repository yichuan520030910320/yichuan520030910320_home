## Welcome to Yichuan Wang(SJTU) Home Pages

I am a 3rd year undergraduate student in the ACM honor class of Shanghai Jiaotong University, majoring in computer science and technology. I am interested in machine learning systems and high-performance computing (to be more detailed maybe distributed systems for large model training, and memory optimization solutions for AI model training).

**! Earnestly looking for Phd position in 2024 Fall**



Currently, I am also working with Prof.Li [Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/) in NYU on a project related with large scale GNN training 

I will be in NYC for the second half of 2023.



In SJTU, I am supervised by [quan-chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/) at EPCC. 

The most recent work is to complete the construction and optimization of a dynamic neural network reasoning framework with EPCC Lab and Microsoft Research Asia. 

The paper is accepted by OSDI23 now.
