## Welcome to Yichuan Wang(SJTU) Home Pages

I am a 3rd year undergraduate student in the acm honor class of Shanghai Jiaotong University, majoring in computer science and technology. I am interested in machine learning systems and high-performance computing (to be more detailed maybe distributed systems for AI large model training, and memory optimization solutions for AI model training), supervised by [quan-chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/) at EPCC. I like to communicate with different people, so you can feel free to contact me at yichuanjiaoda@sjtu.edu.cn or wechat:15858459091 or yichuanwang0324

**! Earnestly looking for Phd position in 2024 Fall**

The most recent work is to complete the construction and optimization of a dynamic neural network reasoning framework with EPCC Lab and Microsoft Research Asia. This paper is currently under the review process of OSDI23.

The paper is accepted by OSDI23 now.

Currently, I am also working with Prof.Li [Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/) on a project related with large scale GNN training 

If you are willing to know more details, you can see my [cv](https://docdro.id/BYefBJB) here.
