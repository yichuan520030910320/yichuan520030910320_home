## Welcome to Yichuan Wang Home Pages

I am a 20th grade student in the acm honor class of Shanghai Jiaotong University, majoring in computer science and technology. I am interested in machine learning systems and high-performance computing, supervised by quan-chen at EPCC. I like to communicate with different people, so you can feel free to contact me at yichuanjiaoda@sjtu.edu.cn or wechat:15858459091 or yichuanwang0324

The most recent work is to complete the construction and optimization of a dynamic neural network reasoning framework with EPCC Lab and Microsoft Research Asia. This paper is currently under the review process of OSDI23.
